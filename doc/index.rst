**Plyvel** is a fast and feature-rich Python interface to LevelDB_.

.. _LevelDB: http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/

Plyvel's key features are:

* **Rich feature set**

  Plyvel wraps most of the LevelDB C++ API and adds some features of its own. In
  addition to basic features like getting, putting and deleting data, Plyvel
  allows you to use write batches, database snapshots, very flexible iterators,
  prefixed databases, bloom filters, custom cache sizes, custom comparators, and
  other goodness LevelDB has to offer.

* **Friendly Pythonic API**

  Plyvel has a friendly and well-designed API that uses Python idioms like
  iterators and context managers (``with`` blocks), without sacrificing the
  power or performance of the underlying LevelDB C++ API.

* **High performance**

  Plyvel executes all performance-critical code at C speed (using Cython_),
  which means Plyvel is a good fit for high-performance applications.

  .. _Cython: http://cython.org/

* **Extensive documentation**

  Plyvel comes with extensive documentation, including a user guide and API
  reference material.
